\title{Independence of Continuous R.V.s}
\taxon{definition}

\p{
  Continuous random variables #{X} and #{Y} are \strong{independent} if:
  
  ##{
    f_{X, Y}(x, y) = f_X(x) f_Y(y)
  }

  It is also equivalent to:

  ##{
    f_{X \mid Y}(x \mid y) = f_X(x) \quad \text{and} \quad f_{Y \mid X}(y \mid x) = f_Y(y)
  }
}
