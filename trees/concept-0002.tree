\p{
  A \strong{graph} is a collection of vertices and edges. An edge connects two vertices. We can represent a graph as #{G = (V, E)}, where #{V} is the set of vertices and #{E} is the set of edges.
}

\p{
  A graph can be directed or undirected, edge #{(u, v)} in a directed graph has a direction from #{u} to #{v}, while in an undirected graph, the edge has no direction (can be denoted as #{\{u, v\}}).
